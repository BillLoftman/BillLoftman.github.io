    <!-- infograph paragraph -->
    <div class="infograph">
      <p>First, global warming is just another phrase for climate change, which creates a large problem in many environments due to the drastic change in the climate. Climate change is caused by the increase of greenhouse gasses in the Earth’s atmosphere. Since the industrial revolution, concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) have risen in the atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) from 280 parts per million to 393 parts per million. These greenhouse gases absorb and then re-radiate heat in Earth’s atmosphere, which causes increased warming. </p>

    <div class="effects">
      <p>Due to human-induced warming it is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise hasn’t been, and won’t be, uniform or smooth across the globe or over time. Causing the length of the frost-free season (and the corresponding growing season) to increase nationally since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States, affecting ecosystems and agriculture. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen at the current rate of climate change. Average U.S. precipitation has increased since 1900, but some areas have had increases greater than the national average, and some areas have had decreases. More winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century. Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks) everywhere are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense everywhere. As well as summer temperatures are projected to continue rising, and a reduction of soil moisture, which exacerbates heat waves, is projected for much of the western and central U.S. in summer. By the end of this century, what have been once-in-20-year extreme heat days (one-day events) are projected to occur every two or three years over most of the nation. The intensity, frequency and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased since the early 1980s. The relative contributions of human and natural causes to these increases are still uncertain. Hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates are projected to increase as the climate continues to warm. Global sea level has risen by about 8 inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880. It is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100. This is the result of added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms. Finally, the Arctic Ocean is expected to become essentially ice free in the summer before mid-century.

      <p>
          There are many solutions for global warming that we already have access to. Clean energy like solar, wind, and hydropower, but the real problem is getting humans to change. The problem that we need fix is not how to stop global warming, but how to get humans to use the solutions for global warming. The simple answer is to make a law where you just can’t burn fossil fuels for electric power, and then after that for transportation. The would fix the problem, but that likelihood of that ever happening is small because a change that large would affect the economy world wide, and cause problems for everyone including the government. Really the only way that this change is going to be able to take place is if people want to make the change for them self, and that amount of people doing to goes up exponentially. As of now, there is no way to enforce this on everyone, but if more and more people choose to, then that might be something that is able to be done.
