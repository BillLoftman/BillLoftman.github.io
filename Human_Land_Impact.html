  <div class=Q_1_H>
    <h2> How does physical space/land availability initially impact human population? - </h2>
  </div>

  <div class=Q_1>
    <p>
      The human population in an area depends on what that land offers. What biome is it in, what resources
      does that space have, and how large that area is. Also whether or not that area is inhabitable or uninhabitable.
      57% of Earth’s land area is uninhabitable, 33% of that being desert and other 24% being mountainous. If everyone
       would live like an American, everyone on Earth would need 24 acres of habitable space. If you took the total
       inhabitable space on Earth and divided it by 7 billion, you would get about 2.4 acres of land. This means that
       the population of humans that a space can support also depends on how that group of people live. You could fit
       everyone in the state of Texas each with a 33 feet by 33 feet house, but that wouldn’t account for the space of
       everything else that most Americans rely on. That includes farms, shopping centers, entertainments, and places
       of work. That is where the 33x33 feet box turns into 2.4 acres, or turning into 10 Earths.
    </p>

  <div class=Q_2_H>
    <h2> Specifically when and what alterations have humans made to alter our physical space/ land availability? - </h2>
  </div>

  <div class=Q_2>
    <p>
      In most cases, humans have simply altered the Earth’s land, for farming and large infrastructure,
      which takes massive portions of land, and can cause repercussions on the surrounding environment.
      For example, in Dubai there are plans of constructing completely artificial islands in the nearby
      ocean. If this procedure were to become common, it could cause massive changes to the Earth’s ecosystem.
      Unfortunately, some are using these artificial islands to ignore loopholes in environmental regulations,
      which is a problem we will have to overcome in order to make artificial land a viable solution to some
      of our more pressing issues. In addition, these islands could unfortunately cause pollution and rising
       sea levels, though it could also have positive effects. If we had access to artificial islands, we
       could not only provide more habitats for humans and animals, but we could also move some of our farming
       and land-intensive infrastructure to these new artificial islands, thus reducing the strain they put
       on the natural environment.

  <div class=Q_3_H>
    <h2> Examples - </h2>
  </div>

  <div class=Q_3>
    <p>
    An area of Texas can support every person on Earth living in a 33x33 foot box, but couldn’t support each
    person on Earth's unique lifestyle. There is enough space for everyone to eat food, drink water, have shelter,
    and reproduce. Everything takes up physical space. That includes humans. The things that you need to live also
    take up space like your food, water, and shelter. A human can’t be the only animal in an ecosystem or on
    Earth. There has to be other animals and plants to fill the food web, letting humans eat and breath. This all
    take up space, and the more people you add, the more of everything else there needs to be. There needs to be a
    balance between all the organisms in the ecosystem to keep each other living. If you look in at first world
    country, the area that a human needs to live is larger because most of the things that we have don’t come from
    the same place we live (the items we buy or the food we eat). For people in America, the physical space that
    we need includes every place we import from. Any items that have been shipped overseas from different
    countries and anywhere those counties might get their raw materials is included in America's physical space.
    Other countries use less physical space as America.
